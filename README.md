## Inspiration
Because of a pandemic, students have to get used to a new way of learning and doing tasks. It is really hard to sit in front of their desks the whole time for attending classes and doing work. It is easy to lose concentration and students are not as motivated to do work. Therefore, we try to gamify the way students keep track of their work so they can be more motivated.

## What it does
Here's the setting of the "game": Zombies attack your house every 12:00 AM (when a day ends). The only way you can secure your house is to complete the shield by finishing all the tasks that are due on that day. If tasks are not done, your house gets destroyed. To repair it, you have to finish all the past-due tasks. You can add tasks, finish tasks, delete tasks, and show tasks.

## How we built it
We use Java for the whole project. We created some java classes and a main program. We also included a xml parser and a writer.

## Challenges we ran into
We tried to make a UI for the project, but we do not have enough time to finish it by the time the project is due on devpost.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are happy that we completed most of the functions we planned for the program.

## What we learned
Although we did not finish the UI at this time, we still learned quite a lot of the process of making it.

## What's next for Housekeeper
1. Add a reward system for finishing work
2. Penalty for deleting past-due tasks
3. Connect program with UI
